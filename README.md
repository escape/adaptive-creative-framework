# ACF: Adaptive Creative Framework

## Overview

**ACF (Adaptive Creative Framework)** is an evolving, highly opinionated Agile methodology shaped by real-world struggles in creative and political industries. It is designed to balance structure and exploration, providing a practical workflow for agile creative production while ensuring strategic alignment, iterative refinement, and resilience against ideological distortions.

ACF integrates cross-disciplinary research, epistemological validation, and iterative prototyping to refine creative work through a structured yet adaptable process.

## Disclaimer

This framework is in continuous development. While it draws from direct experience and established best practices, it may not address every unique context. Users are encouraged to adapt it as needed to fit their specific objectives.

## Framework Structure

ACF consists of **seven core phases**, each reinforcing an iterative, knowledge-driven approach:

### 1. Cognitive Framing
Define the conceptual boundaries of the project and ensure alignment with cross-disciplinary insights.

- Identify core questions, constraints, and assumptions.
- Conduct contextual research on relevant historical, artistic, and technological references.
- Align team mindset or, if working solo, establish a creative manifesto.

**Outcome:** A clear "creative compass" ensuring conceptual consistency.

### 2. Divergent Exploration
Expand creative possibilities before converging on a final direction.

- Generate a broad range of raw ideas without immediate evaluation.
- Apply sensemaking techniques to identify emerging themes and patterns.
- Conduct micro-experiments such as sketches, prototypes, or mood boards.

**Outcome:** A diverse pool of creative directions before committing to a specific path.

### 3. Directional Convergence
Select and refine the most viable concepts based on analytical and creative considerations.

- Filter and prioritize ideas according to feasibility, impact, and strategic relevance.
- Ensure epistemic rigor by validating ideas across relevant disciplines.
- Define hypotheses and potential risks for the next phase.

**Outcome:** A small number of validated creative directions.

### 4. Iterative Crafting
Develop, test, and refine creative work in short, structured iterations.

- Implement agile-style sprints to prototype and refine components.
- Gather real-world feedback from collaborators, audiences, or mentors.
- Conduct micro-retrospectives to assess learnings from each iteration.

**Outcome:** Progressively improved creative artifacts.

### 5. Polishing and Integration
Ensure coherence, quality, and alignment of all creative elements.

- Conduct a final review to assess overall coherence and interdisciplinary consistency.
- Merge different components into a unified, polished whole.
- Perform pre-final validation through testing, critiques, or audience feedback.

**Outcome:** A refined, high-quality final product.

### 6. Final Product
Deliver, launch, or present the completed work.

- Provide the necessary context or narrative for audience engagement.
- Gather both formal and informal reactions.
- Conduct a final retrospective to refine future processes.

**Outcome:** A completed creative project and key insights for future improvements.

### 7. Continuous Learning
An embedded layer of iterative improvement throughout all phases.

- Maintain feedback loops to refine methodology and creative output.
- Adapt dynamically based on new insights and constraints.
- Approach each sprint as both a production cycle and a learning opportunity.

**Outcome:** A self-improving process that evolves over time.

## Epistemological Frameworking

Unlike traditional Agile methodologies, ACF integrates **epistemological validation** to ensure that creative work is not only aesthetically compelling but also analytically and theoretically sound.

Key principles include:

- **Dedicated backlog items** for knowledge validation and theoretical integrity.
- **Knowledge Steward role** to oversee interdisciplinary coherence.
- **AI-assisted epistemic checks** to identify conceptual blind spots and enhance cross-domain insights.

## Repository Structure

ACF is best managed as a structured hierarchy of modular markdown files, rather than a single long document. This ensures ease of editing, expansion, and collaboration.
